# Personalized News Chatbot with FastAPI, News API, and ChatGPT

This project demonstrates the development of a personalized news chatbot using FastAPI, the News API for fetching news articles, and ChatGPT for handling natural language interactions. The chatbot allows users to query news articles on topics of interest and engages them in natural conversations.

## Features

- **FastAPI Backend**: Utilizes FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
  
- **News API Integration**: Fetches real-time news articles from the News API based on user queries. The News API provides a rich source of news data from various sources worldwide.

- **ChatGPT for Natural Language Processing**: Uses OpenAI's ChatGPT to generate responses and engage users in conversational interactions. ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model that can provide natural and informative responses based on user queries.

- **Personalized Interaction**: Offers personalized news recommendations and summaries based on user input, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

## Project Structure

- **`app/`**: Contains the main application files.
  - **`main.py`**: Sets up the FastAPI server and defines API endpoints.
  - **`news_api.py`**: Handles interactions with the News API to fetch news articles based on user queries.
  
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all necessary dependencies for the project, ensuring seamless installation.

- **`README.md`**: Provides detailed instructions for setting up the project, including installation steps, usage examples, and additional notes for developers.

## Installation and Usage

To run the Personalized News Chatbot locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-chatbot.git
   cd news-chatbot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your API keys:
   - Obtain a News API key from [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/) and replace `'YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY'` in `news_api.py`.
   - Obtain an OpenAI API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and replace `'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'` in `chatbot.py`.

4. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

5. Use the chatbot via API endpoints:
   - Send POST requests to `http://localhost:8000/query/` with JSON data `{"query": "your query here"}` to interact with the chatbot.
